# Long-range-fpv-wing
A long range highly efficnet fixed wing fpv plane that can be controlled manually or autonomously for way point missions

My aim for this project was to create a highly efficient plane that doesn't require a 3d printer to create advanced shapes. I thought to myself how could I do it? Then I discovered hotwire cutting. It allows you to create a highly intricate pattern by using stencils. Aswell as that the material that it uses is very light weight and cheap.


I spent far to long on the cad of this project. I started of with no prior cad experience and in less than 20 hours I created an aerodynamic airplane body and ran in through virtual wind tunnels. This is my final design.

For the BOM I would only recommend one change. Instead of getting the matek flight controller I would have preferred to have got speedybee f405 wing but it wasn't in stock anywhere in the UK. Also if you want to see the links use the BOM.csv because the links were to long to fit here.
