## 11/2/2025 - Research  on aerodynamics   

I have just started doing research onto how the aerodynamics of the plane will work I am trying find out what the optimal size and material for it is aswell. ![IMG_20251102_165450881](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzgxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--25d90215e8a9f5f64b13d17e5cdd4f9457997d1f/IMG_20251102_165450881.jpg)
  

## 11/3/2025 - Decided on the naca 2412 airfoil   

After extensive research and testing I have decided to use the naca 2412 airfoil I chose it because it is very efficient and because it will not be to hard to hot wire out off epp foam![IMG_20251103_095426886](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODAxMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6b6ab09ebfd94f957e45dd9403978924a1ecfcba/IMG_20251103_095426886.jpg)![IMG_20251103_095333241](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODAxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c396780d8c37113527ad17d85ed67368c2f83ef8/IMG_20251103_095333241.jpg)



  

## 11/4/2025 - Changed to a twin boom design  

After looking into more details at the aerodynamics I decided that a twin boom be a lot more efficient than the tail plane I was originally thinking about. It is more efficient because  there is less drag and weight because the body doesnt have to be that. Also now I am slowly beginning to understand cad and have started designing the actual body. ![17622876832747852634861935741432](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODM4MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--68eaa89ef077559632b9486a5e946a339ce00247/17622876832747852634861935741432.jpg)
  

## 11/5/2025 - Finalising body design   

After much struggle trying to work out how to use ondhape I have finally finished my body design. It took. So much longer than I though because Cad is so hard. ![IMG_20251105_163134621](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODY3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--b70a82212f15fe62d2950bd4c6c15c841097ce0f/IMG_20251105_163134621.jpg)
